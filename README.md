Data extraction:
1. Selenium was used to extract real estate data. 
2. Download chromedriver and declare its path in the code.

Machine learning:
1. Various machine learning algorithms were applied on data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction
2. Machine learning algorithms like random forest, gradient boosting, linear regression were applied tp predict price of properties and an artificial neural network was trained to predict prices.
